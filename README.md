# 39dylib V0.1

Welcome to the official repo for the 39dylib library! 39dylib is a socket library for Darwin (Mac OS X, iOS), Linux (Desktop and Android), and Windows. It was designed to provide a simple socket extension for Mark Overmars' and YoYo Games's GameMaker software. 

39dylib is based on and forked from Luke Graham's (39ster) popular 39dll library, which is in the public domain. 

You can get binaries for 39dylib from http://www.vetragames.com/software/. This is merely a repo for the source code.

## Project Status

39dylib should be considered alpha software, and is still a WIP. It has been used for a number of commercial projects in the past, but not everything will work out of the box.

- **iOS version:** fully ported!
